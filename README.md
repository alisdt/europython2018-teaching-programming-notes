# Notes from discussion on teaching programming to beginners at EuroPython 2018

## Emotions in learners -- confidence and fear

A belief of the teacher in talent will determine their attitude. A teacher who
believes in talent will give up on students they see as "untalented", one who
does not has the motivation to persist with them. Stupid is a state not a
property!

It's better to praise for effort rather than results -- "you worked hard on
that problem".

Often we think of younger people and children on this topic, but it affects
older people too. Some are suffering "culture shock".

Students with the courage to try new things do better -- how can we encourage
the timid?

Start with little successes: keep the learning gradient shallow, give motivating
examples.

It matters whether the class is voluntary or compulsory (though even those
  at voluntary classes will get bored).

Serg's example: Scratch game for kids was very popular, but in Python they got
bored -- more effort and detail required to get a result.

Seeing that something is possible is important. Maybe use an example solution
from a student, rather than your own? Scratch has a way to do this, edublocks
and JupyterHub might too.

Seeing the instructor make mistakes is important -- see this as a normal part
of the process, and even experienced programmers do it continuously.

Immediate results are essential. Ideally the students will be in a state of
"flow", the two preconditions for this are the right difficulty level (not too 
  hard, not too easy) and that there is a tight feedback loop.

Never say "it's easy". Alternatives:
* "You did the last one really well"
* "Why not give it a try?" or "where do you think you could start?"

## Focus -- how to keep students' attention, stop boredom

Make the material as relevant as possible to your students!

Choose a real world problem, if possible.

Visual results:
* turtle graphics
* physical computing
* PyGame Zero

Have the exercises be *simple* but *real*:
* Simplified for the student
* Real problem to solve
* Result looks like something you know or use

Examples:
* games
* things that can be understood easily
* visualisations
* IPyWidgets / graphs to show results of functions

Give existing code for student to tinker with, not get them to build from
scratch. This will give a visible result quicker.

"How would you fix this?" broken code challenges.

Test Driven Teaching -- give the student unit tests and they fill in
implementation

## Conceptual problems

Some students have never heard of mathematical functions! An example of
very specific "blind spots" -- there are many others

Acting out concepts or behaving as running a program:
* functions
* turtles
* loops
* acting out OpenStack

Better error messages (think Mu has improved this a little)

Teach students to break up problems -- it's not like writing an essay.

## Differing ability levels

Group students and get them to help each other. Or, when a student has a
problem, get another student who understands the problem to help them.

Some people came along for the wrong reason -- with their friends, to collect
CV points, because they feel they should. Very passive as students and don't
want to interact. Flipped classroom may help with this -- the passive part
is over outside the classroom and everything in the actual session is
interactive.

Create mixed ability groups -- like code dojos or Valle(?) schools.

Try a nonlinear structure, this allows the more advanced students to jump ahead
and not get bored.
